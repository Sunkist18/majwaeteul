1. Try `git clone` in the VS Code instance console.
2. The popup will appear to authenticate to GitHub.
3. Allow the extension to authenticate (it doesn't look very convincing, but
this is the account of the VS Code Server author)
4. You will be redirected to a non-working page. Do not close it.
5. Copy the browser address of your VS Code instance & paste it instead the
part before `/callback(...)` part of the non-working page. Do not close it.
6. At the end of the address there will be `?code=(...)&state=(...)`,
copy these.
7. Go to the VS Code instance.
8. In the status bar there's something like `GitHub: authenticating...`,
click it.
9. Paste values to the format
`vscode://vscode.github-authentication/did-authenticate?code=(...)&(...)`
and put into the popup.
10. Voila, you are logged in.
